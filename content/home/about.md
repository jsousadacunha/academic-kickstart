Passionate computer engineer with more than 12 years' experience. Over the last 5 years I'm working as Lead Software Engineer for large backend Java/Java EE projects.      
My international career provides me a unique perspective of the profession and that brought me the opportunity to develop my skills in various sectors such as banking, health, industry, public and energy.  

Also, I'm a fanatic of running and trail-running. I search always new challenges and I try to surpass myself.
